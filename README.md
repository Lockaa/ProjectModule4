# Module 4: Backend Development with Node.js and MongoDB
# Task 4:
    Implement a basic user authentication system using JWT in a Node.js application. 
# Assignment:
    1. Set up a simple Express server with routes to register and login users.
    2. Use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to authenticate users.
    3. Implement registration and login endpoints.
    4. Ensure users can only access protected routes if they are logged in (JWT required). 
# Deliverables:
    ● A Node.js server with JWT authentication.
    ● Registration and login routes.
    ● A protected route that requires authentication.
