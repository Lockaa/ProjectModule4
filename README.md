# Module 4: Backend Development with Node.js and MongoDB
# Task 4:
    Implement a basic user authentication system using JWT in a Node.js application. 
# Assignment:
    1. Set up a simple Express server with routes to register and login users.
    2. Use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to authenticate users.
    3. Implement registration and login endpoints.
    4. Ensure users can only access protected routes if they are logged in (JWT required). 
# Deliverables:
    ● A Node.js server with JWT authentication.
    ● Registration and login routes.
    ● A protected route that requires authentication.

    started & filled in README file                                                         14:00 - 14:20
    re-researched & re-studied JWT                                                          14:20 - 14:50
    set up express & node.js server                                                         15:00 - 15:20
    have basic JWL backend template in                                                      15:20 - 15:45
    more planning (thinking how to do frontend)                                             15:45 - 16:00

    2/16/2025:
    current goal is to set up the front end side of things (the actual webpage/interface)   11:00
    remade backend                                                                          11:00 - 11:30
    okay so, I'm confused as to if I'm supposed to have a designated front end website, or
    just have it run off of POST commands via something like Insomnia
    most of my reasearch is pointing towards the latter, of using something like Insomnia 
    to check the routes and etc, so I'm just going to use that                              11:30

    So, it should be working, just need to test it (probably through Insomnia)              11:30

    Testing                                                                                 11:30 - 12:00


# Challenges: 
    Actually figuring out exactly what I'm doing and what counts as JWT, so just finding out the general program specs was, weird to say the least. the rest of it wasn't too bad just googling how to do things mainly.
